# maker
This is really easy script for easy running make with parameters.

## Install
Best way right now is to clone this repository somewhere and link maker into ~/bin or add it to your $PATH

## Usage
You have to copy one of mine Makefiles or create your own. After that you can run maker $TARGET $PARAMS and all $PARAMS will be pased to make as variable (look in some Makefile)

## Plans
 - automatic checking of new version of maker
 - automatic install of choisen Makefile
 - automatic update of installed Makefile
